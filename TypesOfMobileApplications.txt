Native Apps:

Native apps are built specifically for a mobile device’s operating system (OS). 
Thus, you can have native Android mobile apps or native iOS apps, not to mention 
all the other platforms and devices. 
Because they’re built for just one platform, you cannot mix and match – say, use a Blackberry app on an 
Android phone or use an iOS app on a Windows phone.

Web Apps:

Web apps behave similarly to native apps but are accessed via a web browser on your mobile device. 
They’re not standalone apps in the sense of having to download and install code into your device. 
They’re actually responsive websites that adapt its user interface to the device the user is on. 
In fact, when you come across the option to “install” a web app, it often simply bookmarks the website URL on your device.

Hybrid Apps:

And then there are the hybrid apps. 
These are web apps that look and feel like native apps. 
They might have a home screen app icon, responsive design, fast performance, even be able to 
function offline, but they’re really web apps made to look native.
